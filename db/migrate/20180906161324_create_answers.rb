      # The above creates a `question_id` column of type `big_int`
      # It also sets a foreign_key contraint to enforce the association
      # with the questions table at the database level.
      # The 'question_id' will refer to an `id` of a row in the
      # questions table.
      # It is said that the answer belongs to the question.

      # Big Int can go from -9_223_372_036_854_775_807 to
      # 9223372036854775807.

      # Int can go from -2_147_483_648 to 2147483648
